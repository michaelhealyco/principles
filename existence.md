I choose to continue to exist: 
 - because true love exists
 - because I have learned to fiercely reject selfishness and suicide is fundamentally selfish
 - because there may be certain mysteries which only I can ever fathom
 - because this world is often hateful, tyrannical, and destructive 
   and these dominating attributes must be eliminated if this world is to continue existing
 - because I am indebted to those I've wronged out of unknowingness, 
   and I strongly desire to use my learned understandings to 
   wherever possible prevent further unnecessary suffering among others
 - because "I" wish not to experience unnecessary suffering 
   in future incarnations which could have been prevented in this one. 
 - because this world can still be beautiful
 - because I still love myself.
